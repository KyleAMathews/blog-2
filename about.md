## Tadeu Zagallo

I'm a Software Engineer currently working on [React
Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native) at
[Facebook](http://code.facebook.com).

I've been
programming for about 5 years now, and have worked with several technologies
during this time. Now working mostly with Objective-C and C, focusing on React
Native's performance.

On my own time I like to learn about compilers and low level programming, and
every once in a while I take a stab at writing a compiler for my own language.
So far it hasn't resulted in anything I'm proud of, but I still believe it's a
great way to learn :)
